# CODE CHALLENGE Solution

## Probelm

An address provider returns addresses only with concatenated street names and numbers. Our own system on the other hand has separate fields for street name and street number.

**Input:** string of address

**Output:** string of street and string of street-number as JSON object

1. Write a simple program that does the task for the most simple cases, e.g.
   1. `"Winterallee 3"` -> `{"street": "Winterallee", "housenumber": "3"}`
   1. `"Musterstrasse 45"` -> `{"street": "Musterstrasse", "housenumber": "45"}`
   1. `"Blaufeldweg 123B"` -> `{"street": "Blaufeldweg", "housenumber": "123B"}`

2. Consider more complicated cases
   1. `"Am Bächle 23"` -> `{"street": "Am Bächle", "housenumber": "23"}`
   1. `"Auf der Vogelwiese 23 b"` -> `{"street": "Auf der Vogelwiese", "housenumber": "23 b"}`

3. Consider other countries (complex cases)
   1. `"4, rue de la revolution"` -> `{"street": "rue de la revolution", "housenumber": "4"}`
   1. `"200 Broadway Av"` -> `{"street": "Broadway Av", "housenumber": "200"}`
   1. `"Calle Aduana, 29"` -> `{"street": "Calle Aduana", "housenumber": "29"}`
   1. `"Calle 39 No 1540"` -> `{"street": "Calle 39", "housenumber": "No 1540"}`


## Solution 

By looking at the test cases I identified two main classifications based on the occurance of comma, so the first logic was to handle the cases where the comma is the separator between the street and house number. now comes the cases where there is no comma, the pattern identified is that house the number starts with the last occurrence of numerics in the string based on that, the logic is applied and the special cases where are considered in implementing the logic for this classification For example the case where numerics also appear in a street name like "Calle 39 No 1540" so the later appearing numerics are the house number in such scenarios street name ends with the first occurrence of numerics.
